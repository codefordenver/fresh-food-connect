//this is an example of how to set up the apiConfig.js file
//make sure that in your local repos .git/info/exclude it includes
// ffc/server/apiConfig/apiConfig.js
//this will exclude this file from git commits and will protect your api key
//make a file called apiConfig.js in the same folder as this file
//   in apiConfig.js put
//   var googleGeoCodeApiKey = 123yourApiKey123;
// googleGeoCodeApiKey will be reffrenced elsewhere in the server code
